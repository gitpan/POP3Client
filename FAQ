==============================================================

1. Does the module handle attachments?

The module downloads the message in raw format.  It does not do
anything special with attachments.  To do that, use MIME::Parser or
something like it.  MIME::Parser has a method called parse_data that
accepts and array of lines.  Pass it the results of the Body method as
follows:

my @lines = $pop->Body( $n );
$parser->parse_data( @lines );


2. How do I install it if my ISP won't?

You have 2 choices.  You can go through the installation process using
a prefix option to the make command like this:

	% perl Makefile.PL prefix=/some/other/directory

then just make; make install as above.

Or you can create a directory called Mail somewhere and just put
POP3Client.pm in there.  You will then have to put this directory into
your include path (@INC) either on the command line or in you code
(i.e. push(@INC,"/path/to/directory"); ).  You need to include the
directory above Mail.

Choice 1 is better because you can track what modules you have
installed but if you don't have command line access you'll have to go
with choice 2.


3. Can I check to see if I have new mail?

Not directly.  You'd have to keep track of the messages read from the
last connection (using Uidl).  It's not something the protocol supports.


4. How do I tell if the connection worked or not?

Check the Count() method.  A value of -1 means that the connection
failed.  You will have access to the other methods on the object to
see the Message, etc.  This will be changed sometime in the future so
that the constructor (or the Connect() method) will return undef or 0
on failure.
