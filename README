WHAT IS IT?

This is a POP3 client module for perl5.  It provides an
object-oriented interface to a POP3 server.  It can be used to write
perl-based biff clients, mail readers, or whatever.  See the inline
POD doco for more details.  (perldoc Mail::POP3Client)


HOW DO I INSTALL/TEST IT?

To install Mail::POP3Client:

% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make test
% make install

NOTE: if you want to test against a real mailbox, set the environment
variable POPTESTACCOUNT to some POP3 account in the following format:
user:password:host.

% export POPTESTACCOUNT=jsmith:secret:pop3.my.do.main
% make test


WHERE IS THE DOCUMENTATION?

The documentation is in the code in POD format.  To read it, use
'perldoc Mail::POP3Client' or you can extract it to html using
pod2html.
