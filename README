This is version 1.18 of Mail::POP3Client.  

Changes from version 1.17 to 1.18:
	+ fixed typo in Body ($$line = ...)
	+ remove set of $\
	+ once again, fix the distribution (this time I built it on a
	  Unix box.  Thanks to Terry Sigle.)

Changes from version 1.16 to 1.17:
	+ fixed newline/carriage return problem in distribution.

Changes from version 1.15 to 1.16:
	+ replaced all occurences of chop with chomp.  Should make it
	  more compatible on machines like the Mac.
	+ Removed all uses of $_ =.  Uses locally declared variables
	  now.
	+ Now compiles with no warnings.
