This is version 1.21 of Mail::POP3Client.  

Changes from version 1.23 to 1.23:
	+ fixed bug in Head when optional number of lines is not passed,
	  set to zero if undefined or non-numeric (submitted by Bjoern
	  Kriews <bkr@cut.de>)

Changes from version 1.21 to 1.22:
	+ change Retrieve to return HeadAndBody.  It was using too
	  much memory by building both an array and a string to
	  return.

Changes from version 1.19 to 1.21:
	+ add SYNOPSIS info for perldoc.
	+ add support for previewing messages using second integer
	  argument to Head, as in $pop->Head( 0, 10 ), which would get
	  the headers and the first 10 lines of the body for message
	  0.  Contributed by Dennis Moroney <dennis@hub.iwl.net>
	+ convert prints to carps.
	+ change local to my.

Changes from version 1.18 to 1.19:
	+ added basic APOP support patches from Gerhard Gonter
	  <gonter@falbala.wu-wien.ac.at>.  Login does not currently
	  auto-detect APOP on the server.

Changes from version 1.17 to 1.18:
	+ fixed typo in Body ($$line = ...)
	+ remove set of $\
	+ once again, fix the distribution (this time I built it on a
	  Unix box.  Thanks to Terry Sigle.)

Changes from version 1.16 to 1.17:
	+ fixed newline/carriage return problem in distribution.

Changes from version 1.15 to 1.16:
	+ replaced all occurences of chop with chomp.  Should make it
	  more compatible on machines like the Mac.
	+ Removed all uses of $_ =.  Uses locally declared variables
	  now.
	+ Now compiles with no warnings.
