Revision history for Perl extension Mail::POP3Client.

This is version 2.3 of Mail::POP3Client.  

2.3  1999/10/11
	+ fixed problem where lines beginning with '.' in a mail
          message were not having the extra '.' removed.  The POP3
          server adds this '.' to escape the original '.' so that it
          is not interpreted as the end of message marker.  Pointed
          out by Jim Osborne @ Wingra.com.

2.2  1999/10/10
	+ fixed problem with MacPerl and lingering CR/LF chars on the
          socket.

2.1  1999/08/19
	+ moved all socket IO to 2 methods to allow debug to print all
	  socket IO. (mitra@earth.path.net)
	+ fixed some places where you could get an empty string
	  returned as an error when calling from an array context.
	  Now returns nothing (false for both array and scalar
	  context).
	+ defaults to APOP (digest) as authentication mode.  Will
	  switch to PASS (cleartext) if server does not claim to
	  support APOP.  This will mean less passwords sent in
	  cleartext.
	+ fixed example in the Synopsis section (missing argument to
	  Head).
	+ added a simple documentation line for Uidl

2.00 1999/04/29 - major rebuild, including:
	+ changed to hash-style constructor.  See the inline doco.
	  This will be the only supported constructor in later
	  versions.
	+ changed underlying socket code to use IO::Socket.  Timeout
	  settings on the socket are now supported so you can make
	  sure that POP accesses do not hang.
	+ added tests (use POPTESTACCOUNT environment variable to use:
	  '% POPTESTACCOUNT=userid:password:host make test')
	+ module passes strict
	+ you can construct a Mail::POP3Client object which does not
	  auto-connect (by not passing in a USER and PASSWORD) and
	  then connect manually

1.23 1999/04/16
	+ fixed bug in Head when optional number of lines is not passed,
	  set to zero if undefined or non-numeric (submitted by Bjoern
	  Kriews <bkr@cut.de>)

1.22 1999/04/15
	+ change Retrieve to return HeadAndBody.  It was using too
	  much memory by building both an array and a string to
	  return.

1.21 1999/04/08
	+ add SYNOPSIS info for perldoc.
	+ add support for previewing messages using second integer
	  argument to Head, as in $pop->Head( 0, 10 ), which would get
	  the headers and the first 10 lines of the body for message
	  0.  Contributed by Dennis Moroney <dennis@hub.iwl.net>
	+ convert prints to carps.
	+ change local to my.

1.19 198/12/04
	+ added basic APOP support patches from Gerhard Gonter
	  <gonter@falbala.wu-wien.ac.at>.  Login does not currently
	  auto-detect APOP on the server.

1.18 1998/12/04
	+ fixed typo in Body ($$line = ...)
	+ remove set of $\
	+ once again, fix the distribution (this time I built it on a
	  Unix box.  Thanks to Terry Sigle.)

1.17 1998/11
	+ fixed newline/carriage return problem in distribution.

1.16 1998/09
	+ replaced all occurences of chop with chomp.  Should make it
	  more compatible on machines like the Mac.
	+ Removed all uses of $_ =.  Uses locally declared variables
	  now.
	+ Now compiles with no warnings.
